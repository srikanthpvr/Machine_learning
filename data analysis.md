how do you handle large amounts of data such as 100GB of data for wrangling and data visulaisation and dash boarding
  which tools will be used for the above tasks

how do you handle the data which are in different locations and different formats to bring it to single format.
  **Handling Large Datasets for Wrangling, Visualization, and Dashboarding**

When dealing with large datasets, it's crucial to employ efficient tools and techniques. Here are some effective approaches and tools:

**Data Wrangling:**

* **Dask:** This library is designed for parallel computing, making it ideal for large-scale data processing tasks. It can handle large datasets by breaking them down into smaller chunks and processing them in parallel.
* **PySpark:** Built on Apache Spark, PySpark is a powerful tool for big data processing. It provides a distributed computing framework that can handle large datasets efficiently.
* **Pandas:** While not specifically designed for massive datasets, Pandas can be used for smaller datasets or for initial exploration. However, for extremely large datasets, consider using Dask or PySpark.

**Data Visualization and Dashboarding:**

* **Plotly:** A versatile visualization library that can handle large datasets efficiently, creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
* **Dash:** A Python framework for building web applications and dashboards. It can be used to create interactive dashboards that can handle large datasets.
* **Tableau:** A powerful data visualization tool that can connect to various data sources, including large datasets. It offers a user-friendly interface for creating interactive dashboards.
* **Power BI:** Another popular data visualization and business intelligence tool that can handle large datasets. It provides a range of features for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

**Cloud-Based Solutions:**

* **AWS:**
    * **Amazon S3:** For storing large datasets.
    * **Amazon EMR:** For running big data processing frameworks like Spark and Hadoop.
    * **Amazon Redshift:** For data warehousing and analytics.
* **Google Cloud Platform:**
    * **Google Cloud Storage:** For storing large datasets.
    * **Google Dataproc:** For running big data processing frameworks like Spark and Hadoop.
    * **Google BigQuery:** For serverless data warehousing and analytics.
* **Microsoft Azure:**
    * **Azure Blob Storage:** For storing large datasets.
    * **Azure Databricks:** For big data analytics and machine learning.
    * **Azure Synapse Analytics:** For data warehousing and analytics.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Storage:** Choose a reliable and scalable storage solution like S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
* **Data Processing:** Use distributed computing frameworks like Spark or Dask to process large datasets efficiently.
* **Data Visualization and Dashboarding:** Select tools that can handle large datasets and provide interactive visualizations.
* **Performance Optimization:** Optimize your code and queries to improve performance. Consider techniques like caching, indexing, and parallel processing.
* **Scalability:** Design your solution to scale as your data grows. Cloud-based solutions offer elastic scalability.

By carefully selecting the right tools and techniques, you can effectively handle large datasets and extract valuable insights.
