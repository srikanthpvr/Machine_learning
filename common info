R2 for training data goodness of fit -how much data is using to explain the variance
for test data accuracy  = 100-MAPE has to be used. MAPE = Mean Absolute percentage error
to explain the customer we need to show MAPE which will explain how much error is model making
For training the hyperparameters we need to use MAE,RMSE,MSE

python has requests module  and flask has request function,jsonify
from requests module we can use requests.loads to read the json file to python object and request.dumps for converting to json file from pyton object

Always use F1 score for classification

clasfication Metrics:
Categorical cross entropy
Binomial cross entropy
