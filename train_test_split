DATA LEAKAGE
  To solve the data leakage issue,always use "fit" & "transform" or "fit_transform" method on  training data and "transform" method for test data 
Fit genearlly calculates or learns from the data however transform will apply the calculations to the data
By using pipelines we can apply transform method without fail to test data before predicting on the test data

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size = 0.2,random_state = 32)
